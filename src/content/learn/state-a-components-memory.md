title: "State: কম্পোনেন্ট এর মেমোরি"
---

<Intro>

ইন্টারেকশনের ফলে প্রায়ই কম্পোনেন্ট কে স্ক্রিনে যা আছে তা পরিবর্তন করতে হয়। ফর্মে টাইপ করলে ইনপুট ফিল্ড আপডেট হয়ে যাওয়া উচিত, ছবির ক্যারোসেল এর "next" এ ক্লিক করলে ডিসপ্লের ছবি বদলানো উচিত, "buy" এ ক্লিক করলে প্রোডাক্ট শপিং কার্ট এ যাওয়া উচিত। কম্পোনেন্ট এর কিছু জিনিস মনে রাখা উচিত, যেমন: বর্তমান ইনপুট ভ্যালু, বর্তমান ছবি, শপিং কার্ট। React এর এমন কম্পোনেন্ট-ভিত্তিক মেমোরি কে *state* বলে।

## যখন সাধারণ ভেরিয়েবল যথেষ্ট নয় {/*when-a-regular-variable-isnt-enough*/}

নিচের কম্পোনেন্টটি একটি ভাস্কর্যের ছবি প্রদর্শন করে। "Next" বাটন এ ক্লিক করলে `index` এর ভ্যালু `1`, এরপর `2` এবং এভাবে পরিবর্তন হয়ে পরের ভাস্কর্যের ছবি দেখানো উচিত। কিন্তু, এটা **কাজ করবে না** (আপনি চেষ্টা করে দেখতে পারেন!):

`handleClick` ইভেন্ট হ্যান্ডলারটি লোকাল ভেরিয়েবল `index` কে আপডেট করছে। তবে, দুটি বিষয় এই পরিবর্তন দেখতে বাধা তৈরি করছে।

1. **লোকাল ভেরিয়েবলগুলো রেন্ডারগুলির মধ্যে স্থায়ী হয় না।** যখন React কোন কম্পোনেন্ট দ্বিতীয়বার রেন্ডার করে, তখন এটি সম্পূর্ণ রূপে নতুন করে রেন্ডার করে—এটি লোকাল ভেরিয়েবলগুলিতে কোনও পরিবর্তন বিবেচনা করে না।
2. **লোকাল ভেরিয়েবলগুলিতে পরিবর্তন রেন্ডারগুলি ট্রিগার করে না।** নতুন ডেটার জন্যে React তার কম্পোনেন্ট কে নতুন করে রেন্ডার করার প্রয়োজন মনে করে না।

একটি কম্পোনেন্টকে নতুন ডেটা দিয়ে আপডেট করতে, দুটি বিষয় হতে হবে:

1. রেন্ডার এর মধ্যে ডাটা **Retain** করা।
2. কম্পোনেন্টকে নতুন ডাটা দিয়ে রেন্ডার করতে রিয়েক্ট কে **Trigger** করা। (রি-রেন্ডারিং)

[`useState`](/reference/react/useState) হুক আপনাকে নিচের দুটি জিনিস দেয়ঃ

1. একটি **state ভেরিয়েবল** যা রি-রেন্ডারের মধ্যে ডাটা মনে রাখে।
2. একটি **state setter ফাংশন** যা দিয়ে ভেরিয়েবল আপডেট করা যায় এবং রিয়েক্ট কে ট্রিগার করে কম্পোনেন্টকে আবার রেন্ডার করতে।

## State ভেরিয়েবল তৈরি করা {/*adding-a-state-variable*/}

State ভেরিয়েবল তৈরি করতে হলে,রিয়েক্ট থেকে ফাইলের উপরে `useState` ইমপোর্ট করতে হবেঃ

```js
import { useState } from 'react';
```

এরপর, নিচের লাইন টা পরিবর্তন করেঃ

```js
let index = 0;
```

নিচের মতো করে নিন

```js
const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
```

`index` একটি state ভেরিয়েবল এবং `setIndex` হচ্ছে setter ফাংশন।

> এখানে `[` এবং `]` সিনট্যাক্সকে বলা হয় [array destructuring](https://javascript.info/destructuring-assignment) এবং এটা আপনাকে একটি অ্যারে থেকে ভ্যালু রিড করতে দেয়। যেই অ্যারেটা `useState` রিটার্ন করে সেটাতে সব সময় দুটি আইটেম থাকে।

এইভাবে তারা `handleClick` এ একসাথে কাজ করেঃ

```js
function handleClick() {
  setIndex(index + 1);
}
```

এখন "Next" বাটনে ক্লিক করলে বর্তমান ভাস্কর্যটি পরিবর্তন হয়ঃ

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';
import { sculptureList } from './data.js';

export default function Gallery() {
  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);

  function handleClick() {
    setIndex(index + 1);
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>
        Next
      </button>

### আপনার প্রথম হুকের সাথে পরিচয় {/*meet-your-first-hook*/}

React এ, `useState`, এবং অন্য যেকোনো ফাংশন যার শুরু "`use`" দিয়ে তাদেরকে হুক বলা হয়। 

*Hooks* এক ধরনের স্পেশাল ফাংশন যা শুধু React এর [রেন্ডারিং](/learn/render-and-commit#step-1-trigger-a-render) এর সময় কাজ করে (রেন্ডারিং নিয়ে পরের পাতায় আমরা আরো বিস্তারিত জানব)। এরা রিয়েক্ট এর বিভিন্ন ফিচারকে "আঁকরে ধরতে" সাহায্য করে।

State এদের মধ্যে একটি ফিচার, কিন্তু অন্যান্য হুক নিয়ে আমরা পরবর্তীতে জানব।

<Pitfall>

**`use` দিয়ে শুরু হয়েছে এমন Hooks—ফাংশনগুলি—শুধুমাত্র আপনার কম্পোনেন্টগুলির শীর্ষ স্তরে বা [আপনার নিজস্ব Hooks-এ](/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks) কল করা যায়** আপনি কন্ডিশন, লুপ, বা অন্যান্য নেস্টেড ফাংশনের মধ্যে Hooks কল করতে পারবেন না। Hooks হলো ফাংশন, কিন্তু এদের অনেকটা কম্পোনেন্টের নিশর্ত প্রয়োজন হিসাবে ভাবতে পারেন। এইখানে আপনি কম্পোনেন্টের এর উপরে React এর ফিচার "ব্যবহার" করেন অনেকটা যেভাবে ফাইলের উপরে "import" ব্যবহার করে মডিউল লোড করেন।
</Pitfall>

### Anatomy of `useState` {/*anatomy-of-usestate*/}

When you call [`useState`](/reference/react/useState), you are telling React that you want this component to remember something:

```js
const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
```

এই ক্ষেত্রে আপনি চাচ্ছেন রিয়েক্ট `index` টি মনে রাখুক.

<Note>

The convention is to name this pair like `const [something, setSomething]`. You could name it anything you like, but conventions make things easier to understand across projects.

</Note>

The only argument to `useState` is the **initial value** of your state variable. In this example, the `index`'s initial value is set to `0` with `useState(0)`. 

Every time your component renders, `useState` gives you an array containing two values:

1. The **state variable** (`index`) with the value you stored.
2. The **state setter function** (`setIndex`) which can update the state variable and trigger React to render the component again.

Here's how that happens in action:

```js
const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
```

1. **Your component renders the first time.** Because you passed `0` to `useState` as the initial value for `index`, it will return `[0, setIndex]`. React remembers `0` is the latest state value.
2. **You update the state.** When a user clicks the button, it calls `setIndex(index + 1)`. `index` is `0`, so it's `setIndex(1)`. This tells React to remember `index` is `1` now and triggers another render.
3. **Your component's second render.** React still sees `useState(0)`, but because React *remembers* that you set `index` to `1`, it returns `[1, setIndex]` instead.
4. And so on!

## কম্পোনেন্ট এ একাধিক state ভেরিয়েবল ব্যবহার করা {/*giving-a-component-multiple-state-variables*/}

একটি কম্পোনেন্ট এ আপনি যত খুশি তত ধরনের ষ্টেট ভেরিয়েবল রাখতে পারেন। এই কম্পোনেন্ট এর দুটি স্টেট ভেরিয়েবল আছে, একটি নাম্বার `index` এবং একটি বুলিয়ান `showMore` যা Toggle করা হয় যখন আপনি "Show details" এ ক্লিক করেন :

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';
import { sculptureList } from './data.js';

export default function Gallery() {
  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
  const [showMore, setShowMore] = useState(false);

  function handleNextClick() {
    setIndex(index + 1);
  }

  function handleMoreClick() {
    setShowMore(!showMore);
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
  return (
    <>

It is a good idea to have multiple state variables if their state is unrelated, like `index` and `showMore` in this example. But if you find that you often change two state variables together, it might be easier to combine them into one. For example, if you have a form with many fields, it's more convenient to have a single state variable that holds an object than state variable per field. Read [Choosing the State Structure](/learn/choosing-the-state-structure) for more tips.

#### রিয়েক্ট কিভাবে জানে কোন state রিটার্ন করতে হবে? {/*how-does-react-know-which-state-to-return*/}

You might have noticed that the `useState` call does not receive any information about *which* state variable it refers to. There is no "identifier" that is passed to `useState`, so how does it know which of the state variables to return? Does it rely on some magic like parsing your functions? The answer is no.

Instead, to enable their concise syntax, Hooks **rely on a stable call order on every render of the same component.** This works well in practice because if you follow the rule above ("only call Hooks at the top level"), Hooks will always be called in the same order. Additionally, a [linter plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks) catches most mistakes.

Internally, React holds an array of state pairs for every component. It also maintains the current pair index, which is set to `0` before rendering. Each time you call `useState`, React gives you the next state pair and increments the index. You can read more about this mechanism in [React Hooks: Not Magic, Just Arrays.](https://medium.com/@ryardley/react-hooks-not-magic-just-arrays-cd4f1857236e)

This example **doesn't use React** but it gives you an idea of how `useState` works internally:

<Sandpack>

```js index.js active
let componentHooks = [];
let currentHookIndex = 0;

// How useState works inside React (simplified).
function useState(initialState) {
  let pair = componentHooks[currentHookIndex];
  if (pair) {
    // This is not the first render,
    // so the state pair already exists.
    // Return it and prepare for next Hook call.
    currentHookIndex++;
    return pair;
  }

  // This is the first time we're rendering,
  // so create a state pair and store it.
  pair = [initialState, setState];

  function setState(nextState) {
    // When the user requests a state change,
    // put the new value into the pair.
    pair[0] = nextState;
    updateDOM();
  }

  // Store the pair for future renders
  // and prepare for the next Hook call.
  componentHooks[currentHookIndex] = pair;
  currentHookIndex++;
  return pair;
}

function Gallery() {
  // Each useState() call will get the next pair.
  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
  const [showMore, setShowMore] = useState(false);

  function handleNextClick() {
    setIndex(index + 1);
  }

  function handleMoreClick() {
    setShowMore(!showMore);
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
  // This example doesn't use React, so
  // return an output object instead of JSX.
  return {
    onNextClick: handleNextClick,
    onMoreClick: handleMoreClick,
    header: `${sculpture.name} by ${sculpture.artist}`,
    counter: `${index + 1} of ${sculptureList.length}`,
    more: `${showMore ? 'Hide' : 'Show'} details`,
    description: showMore ? sculpture.description : null,
    imageSrc: sculpture.url,
    imageAlt: sculpture.alt
  };
}

function updateDOM() {
  // Reset the current Hook index
  // before rendering the component.
  currentHookIndex = 0;
  let output = Gallery();

  // Update the DOM to match the output.
  // This is the part React does for you.
  nextButton.onclick = output.onNextClick;
  header.textContent = output.header;
  moreButton.onclick = output.onMoreClick;
  moreButton.textContent = output.more;
  image.src = output.imageSrc;
  image.alt = output.imageAlt;
  if (output.description !== null) {
    description.textContent = output.description;
    description.style.display = '';

## State is isolated and private {/*state-is-isolated-and-private*/}

State is local to a component instance on the screen. In other words, **if you render the same component twice, each copy will have completely isolated state!** Changing one of them will not affect the other.

In this example, the `Gallery` component from earlier is rendered twice with no changes to its logic. Try clicking the buttons inside each of the galleries. Notice that their state is independent:

<Sandpack>

```js
import Gallery from './Gallery.js';

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div className="Page">
      <Gallery />
      <Gallery />
    </div>
  );
}

```

```js Gallery.js
import { useState } from 'react';
import { sculptureList } from './data.js';

export default function Gallery() {
  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
  const [showMore, setShowMore] = useState(false);

  function handleNextClick() {
    setIndex(index + 1);
  }

  function handleMoreClick() {
    setShowMore(!showMore);
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
  return (
    <section>
      <button onClick={handleNextClick}>
        Next
      </button>
      <h2>

      </h2>
      <h3>

      </h3>
      <button onClick={handleMoreClick}>
        {showMore ? 'Hide' : 'Show'} details
      </button>
      {showMore && <p>{sculpture.description}</p>}

This is what makes state different from regular variables that you might declare at the top of your module. State is not tied to a particular function call or a place in the code, but it's "local" to the specific place on the screen. You rendered two `<Gallery />` components, so their state is stored separately.

Also notice how the `Page` component doesn't "know" anything about the `Gallery` state or even whether it has any. Unlike props, **state is fully private to the component declaring it.** The parent component can't change it. This lets you add state to any component or remove it without impacting the rest of the components.

What if you wanted both galleries to keep their states in sync? The right way to do it in React is to *remove* state from child components and add it to their closest shared parent. The next few pages will focus on organizing state of a single component, but we will return to this topic in [Sharing State Between Components.](/learn/sharing-state-between-components)

<Recap>

* Use a state variable when a component needs to "remember" some information between renders.
* State variables are declared by calling the `useState` Hook.
* Hooks are special functions that start with `use`. They let you "hook into" React features like state.
* Hooks might remind you of imports: they need to be called unconditionally. Calling Hooks, including `useState`, is only valid at the top level of a component or another Hook.
* The `useState` Hook returns a pair of values: the current state and the function to update it.
* You can have more than one state variable. Internally, React matches them up by their order.
* State is private to the component. If you render it in two places, each copy gets its own state.

#### গ্যালারিটি সম্পূর্ণ করুণ {/*complete-the-gallery*/}

When you press "Next" on the last sculpture, the code crashes. Fix the logic to prevent the crash. You may do this by adding extra logic to event handler or by disabling the button when the action is not possible.

After fixing the crash, add a "Previous" button that shows the previous sculpture. It shouldn't crash on the first sculpture.

Notice how `hasPrev` and `hasNext` are used *both* for the returned JSX and inside the event handlers! This handy pattern works because event handler functions ["close over"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures) any variables declared while rendering.

#### Fix stuck form inputs {/*fix-stuck-form-inputs*/}

When you type into the input fields, nothing appears. It's like the input values are "stuck" with empty strings. The `value` of the first `<input>` is set to always match the `firstName` variable, and the `value` for the second `<input>` is set to always match the `lastName` variable. This is correct. Both inputs have `onChange` event handlers, which try to update the variables based on the latest user input (`e.target.value`). However, the variables don't seem to "remember" their values between re-renders. Fix this by using state variables instead.

<Sandpack>

```js
export default function Form() {
  let firstName = '';
  let lastName = '';

  function handleFirstNameChange(e) {
    firstName = e.target.value;
  }

  function handleLastNameChange(e) {
    lastName = e.target.value;
  }

  function handleReset() {
    firstName = '';
    lastName = '';
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={e => e.preventDefault()}>
      <input
        placeholder="First name"
        value={firstName}
        onChange={handleFirstNameChange}
      />
      <input
        placeholder="Last name"
        value={lastName}
        onChange={handleLastNameChange}
      />
      <h1>Hi, {firstName} {lastName}</h1>
      <button onClick={handleReset}>Reset</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

```css 
h1 { margin-top: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

First, import `useState` from React. Then replace `firstName` and `lastName` with state variables declared by calling `useState`. Finally, replace every `firstName = ...` assignment with `setFirstName(...)`, and do the same for `lastName`. Don't forget to update `handleReset` too so that the reset button works.

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Form() {
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('');
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('');

  function handleFirstNameChange(e) {
    setFirstName(e.target.value);
  }

  function handleLastNameChange(e) {
    setLastName(e.target.value);
  }

  function handleReset() {
    setFirstName('');
    setLastName('');
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={e => e.preventDefault()}>
      <input
        placeholder="First name"
        value={firstName}
        onChange={handleFirstNameChange}
      />
      <input
        placeholder="Last name"
        value={lastName}
        onChange={handleLastNameChange}
      />
      <h1>Hi, {firstName} {lastName}</h1>
      <button onClick={handleReset}>Reset</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

```css 
h1 { margin-top: 10px; }
```

#### ক্র্যাশ ঠিক করুন {/*fix-a-crash*/}

Here is a small form that is supposed to let the user leave some feedback. When the feedback is submitted, it's supposed to display a thank-you message. However, it crashes with an error message saying "Rendered fewer hooks than expected". Can you spot the mistake and fix it?

<Hint>

Are there any limitations on _where_ Hooks may be called? Does this component break any rules? Check if there are any comments disabling the linter checks--this is where the bugs often hide!

</Hint>

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function FeedbackForm() {
  const [isSent, setIsSent] = useState(false);
  if (isSent) {
    return <h1>Thank you!</h1>;
  } else {
    // eslint-disable-next-line
    const [message, setMessage] = useState('');
    return (
      <form onSubmit={e => {
        e.preventDefault();
        alert(`Sending: "${message}"`);
        setIsSent(true);
      }}>
        <textarea
          placeholder="Message"
          value={message}
          onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)}
        />
        <br />
        <button type="submit">Send</button>
      </form>
    );
  }
}
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

Hooks can only be called at the top level of the component function. Here, the first `isSent` definition follows this rule, but the `message` definition is nested in a condition.

Move it out of the condition to fix the issue:

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function FeedbackForm() {
  const [isSent, setIsSent] = useState(false);
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  if (isSent) {
    return <h1>Thank you!</h1>;
  } else {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={e => {
        e.preventDefault();
        alert(`Sending: "${message}"`);
        setIsSent(true);
      }}>
        <textarea
          placeholder="Message"
          value={message}
          onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)}
        />
        <br />
        <button type="submit">Send</button>
      </form>
    );
  }
}
```

</Sandpack>

Remember, Hooks must be called unconditionally and always in the same order!

You could also remove the unnecessary `else` branch to reduce the nesting. However, it's still important that all calls to Hooks happen *before* the first `return`.

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function FeedbackForm() {
  const [isSent, setIsSent] = useState(false);
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  if (isSent) {
    return <h1>Thank you!</h1>;
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={e => {
      e.preventDefault();
      alert(`Sending: "${message}"`);
      setIsSent(true);
    }}>
      <textarea
        placeholder="Message"
        value={message}
        onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)}
      />
      <br />
      <button type="submit">Send</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

Try moving the second `useState` call after the `if` condition and notice how this breaks it again.

If your linter is [configured for React](/learn/editor-setup#linting), you should see a lint error when you make a mistake like this. If you don't see an error when you try the faulty code locally, you need to set up linting for your project. 

</Solution>

#### অপ্রয়োজনীয় state বাদ দিন {/*remove-unnecessary-state*/}

When the button is clicked, this example should ask for the user's name and then display an alert greeting them. You tried to use state to keep the name, but for some reason it always shows "Hello, !".

To fix this code, remove the unnecessary state variable. (We will discuss about [why this didn't work](/learn/state-as-a-snapshot) later.)

আপনি ব্যাখ্যা করতে পারবেন কেন এই state ভেরিয়েবলটি অপ্রয়োজনীয়?

<Sandpack>

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function FeedbackForm() {
  const [name, setName] = useState('');

  function handleClick() {
    setName(prompt('What is your name?'));
    alert(`Hello, ${name}!`);
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>
      Greet
    </button>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

<Solution>

এখানে একটি ঠিক ভার্সন দেওয়া হলো যা ফাংশনের এর মধ্যে প্রয়োজনীয় রেগুলার `name` ভেরিয়েবল ব্যবহার করে:

<Sandpack>

```js
export default function FeedbackForm() {
  function handleClick() {
    const name = prompt('What is your name?');
    alert(`Hello, ${name}!`);
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>
      Greet
    </button>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

State ভেরিয়েবল শুধু রি-রেন্ডার এর মাঝে তথ্য মনে রাখার জন্য দরকার। যেকোনো একই ইভেন্ট হ্যান্ডলার এর মধ্যে রেগুলার ভেরিয়েবলই যথেষ্ট। যেখানে রেগুলার ভেরিয়েবল যথেষ্ট সেখানে state ভেরিবল ব্যবহার করা উচিত না।
